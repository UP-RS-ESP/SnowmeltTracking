# SnowmeltTracking
Algorithm for tracking the onset and end of the snowmelt season from passive microwave data. 

The theory of the algorithm is described in this paper: 
Smith, T., Bookhagen, B., and Rheinwalt, A.: Spatio-temporal Patterns of High Mountain Asia's Snowmelt Season Identified with an Automated Snowmelt Detection Algorithm, 1987â€“2016, The Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2017-67, in review, 2017.

Code developed by Taylor Smith (tasmith@uni-potsdam.de).
